## Project Created for subject on my studies "Advanced Programming"

Application is made in Unity. Everything works asynchronously so everything runs smoothly.
To create this app I used:
- Delegates, 
- Asynchronous Programming,
- Extension Methods
- Json (Serialization, Deserialization)

App is downloading data from web and then by simple login it puts data to proper tabs
